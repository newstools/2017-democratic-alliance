It is no surprise that the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) came out today in support of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as their preferred presidential candidate.The ANCYL has become nothing more than a group of Zuma cheerleaders whose only mission is to secure their own political careers to ensure continued access to state coffers for their own enrichment.Dlamini-Zuma is indeed Jacob Zuma s first choice and therefore the ANCYL follows suitThe fact is that Dlamini-Zuma has recently made a number of particularly concerning remarks that betray how unsuitable she is as a presidential candidate.Specifically, she attacked hundreds of thousands of South Africans who took to the streets to protest against Jacob Zuma, using the old trick of reducing the motivation to racism and claiming that these South Africans wanted to oppose the radical economic transformation , a concept that she, nor any in the ANC seem to be able to define.Dlamini-Zuma also put on display her propensity for conspiracy theories when she recently attacked schools, claiming that children in Model C schools are taught to hate the ANC, and taught that the ANC is corrupt, ANC is bad . She went further to say that some universities such as Wits would not let their students refer to South Africa as a democracy.These views are extremely destructive to nation building and confidence in the economy, meaning fewer economic opportunities for young South Africans.With youth unemployment currently at 65.7% the ANCYL choice shows that they don&#8217;t care about young people getting jobs and getting ahead.Just like her ex-husband, Dlamini-Zuma is an economic wrecking ball.Dlamini-Zuma has also defended ANC ministers who&#8217;ve made headlines recently for all of the wrong reasons, saying &#8220;Ministers that deal with particular issues become targets, you as supporters must protect them.&#8221; This shows that NDZ is a protector of corruption and state capture.South Africa and our youth deserve much better and that is what the DA will deliver in 2019 a government that will prioritise the advancement of the youth over political and financial self-interest.
