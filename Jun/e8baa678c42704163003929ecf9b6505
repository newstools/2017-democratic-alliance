The Democratic Alliance welcomes the appointment of Justice Leona Theron to the Constitutional Court Bench.She has made a significant contribution during her career, and also on the Bench, and we are confident that she will continue the hard work in her new capacity, and contribute to the continued independence of the judiciary.Her appointment comes on the day that the President chose to describe the judiciary as a form of minority rule and a counter to democracy .While these statements are nothing new from the President and are yet more comments in a long line of attacks on the judiciary and their independence, the Democratic Alliance remains confident that the judiciary will remain strong in the face of such unfortunate utterances, and that Justice Theron will, along with her colleagues, jealously guard that independence.
