The following speech was delivered in Parliament today by the DA s Shadow Minister of Finance, David Maynier MP, during the debate on the Appropriations Bill 2017.The Appropriations Bill [B5-2017] provides for an appropriation of R767 billion, from the National Revenue Fund, to fund forty national departments, in 2017/18.We have powers, in terms of the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act (No. 9 of 2009), to rewrite the Appropriations Bill within four months of the beginning of 2017/18.That is why we proposed 405 amendments to the Appropriations Bill, in the amount of R10.8 billion, to fund six proposals in 2017/18.Our budget proposals were aimed at:The amendments we proposed were budget neutral and would have been funded by reprioritising expenditure, within the existing budget, and would have had no effect on the fiscal deficit, which is estimated to be -R149 billion, or -3.1% of GDP, in 2017/18.And yet our budget proposals were not supported by the ANC, not because they did not have merit, and not because they could not be funded, but because it was too difficult to rewrite the budget.But of course the ANC supported an allocation of R1.3 billion for a ministerial jet; R1.4 billion for ministerial bodyguards; and R89.6 million for ministerial mansions, without once thinking about the 9.3 million people who do not have jobs, or have given up looking for jobs, in South Africa.So:We have to ask ourselves why the ANC would not support budget proposals to help South Africa.Well, the answer is simple.They don t care:And they should be ashamed.
