The DA welcomes the decision to place the Secretary to Parliament, Gengezi Mgidlana, on special leave pending an investigation into the serious and multiplicitous allegations levelled against him.The DA has long-standing concerns over Mgidlana s maladministration of Parliament and have raised issues on a number of occasions and in a number of forums.It is our earnest hope that the independent Audit Committee that has been tasked with investigating the allegations will do so thoroughly and without fear or favour. Parliament cannot afford a whitewash and the provisions of the Financial Management of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act must be brought to bear on Mgidlana.We also hope that this committee will cooperate with the Public Protector s Office which is investigating Mgidlana for abuse of power and other transgressions.Mgidlana has been allowed to mismanage Parliament for far too long. He has antagonised and bullied staff with seeming impunity and has facilitated questionable political appointments to senior management positions which now threaten the independence and integrity of the Legislature.We look forward to studying the findings of the Audit Committee which, if done properly, will vindicate us and the brave staffers who have exposed Mgidlana for what he is.
