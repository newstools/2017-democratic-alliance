However, many of these findings still await corrective action from SABC management.In a reply to a DA parliamentary question, Communications Minister, Ayanda Dlodlo, lists a number of alarming findings including SABC missing equipment, failure to disclose business interests, the irregular appointment of employees, procurement irregularities in tender processes, conflict of interest and various cases of fraud and corruption.Some of the findings include, but are not limited to:These reports show how deep corruption runs in the SABC. These findings and reports only scratch the surface of the misconduct happening at the public broadcaster.It is now clear that the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) should start with the mammoth task of addressing all the corruption in the SABC immediately. The SABC interim board Chairperson, Khanyisile Kweyama, indicated in Parliament last week that a request has been sent to the President to sign the proclamation for the SIU to investigate the SABC. The President is yet to sign and must do so immediately for the investigation to commence.The SABC can only get back to its status as a world-class broadcaster once the rot of corruption is weeded out once and for all.
