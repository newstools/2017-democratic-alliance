The meeting of the Finance Committee today was a complete shambles which revealed that SAA losses for the past two months totalled R734 million. This follows losses of R4.8 billion in the 2016/17 financial year.However even more shocking was the fact that:We will not sit back and allow SAA to raid funds under management by the PIC.The only logical solution to ensure the sustainability of SAA and its thousands of employees is to file for business rescue and to stabilise the airline before taking it to the market to find private equity investors.It is also in the public interest that the terms and conditions relating to these maturing loans be made public.That is why I will write to the Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba, to request that he disclose the full terms and conditions relating to renewed or new agreements with lenders to replace the maturing loans.
