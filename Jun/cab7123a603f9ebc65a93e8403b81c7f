We welcome the appointment of Dondo Mogajane as the director-general of National Treasury. His appointment puts to rest fears that a rogue, such as Brian Molefe, may have been appointed to the top job at National Treasury.The fact is Dondo Mogajane is a career professional with nearly eighteen years of service in senior positions within National Treasury.We wish him well because he is going to have his hands full fighting off the fixers, rent seekers and state capturers who are desperate to get their hands on National Treasury.
