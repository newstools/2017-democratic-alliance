The DA has learned with great sadness of the passing of Suna Venter, senior SABC Current Affairs Producer at RSG.We send our deepest condolences to her family, friends and colleagues at RSG.Venter was one of the brave SABC 8 journalists who spoke out against the unlawful interferences and editorial policy changes at the public broadcaster.Suna fought for the freedom, transparency and independence of the media.We note from the statement released by her family today that Venter was recently diagnosed with stress cardiomyopathy, and that those closest to her believed her condition was exacerbated, if not caused, by the events of the past year.She was fearless in her fight, despite suffering undue threats, trauma and victimisation. In the past year Suna was shot in the face with a pellet gun, received threatening messages and was assaulted on three different occasions.The DA will be following up with the SAPS, as shockingly no arrests have been made, despite it being obvious who was responsible for all her suffering.Rest in peace Suna, you have indeed fought the good fight.
