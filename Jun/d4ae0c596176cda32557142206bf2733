The Kempton Park community has been without a South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) office for the last five years. Yet, the Minister of Social Development, Bathabile Dlamini, keeps dodging questions about when and where the new SASSA office will be opened.I will write to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development in Parliament to request that the Minister be called before the committee to explain when she intends to open the much needed SASSA office.The office was initially closed on 28 February 2012, since then, the Department has been dragging its feet in opening a new office.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the aforementioned written replies (here , here and here ) indicate a timeline against which the department will hold itself accountable for opening a SASSA office. It is clear that the Department is simply dragging its feet at the expense of the most vulnerable as there is plenty of office space available in the Kempton Park CBD.SASSA ought to be at the forefront to assist the most vulnerable in our society. Officials must be able to support those who need pensions, child support grants, disability grants or foster care grants. The DA will continue to monitor the progress in establishing a new SASSA office in Kempton Park, to meet this urgent need.
