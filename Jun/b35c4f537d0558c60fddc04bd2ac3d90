We dodged a bullet with Standard &amp; Poor s affirming its sovereign credit rating with a long-term foreign currency sovereign credit rating of BB+ , and a long-term local sovereign currency credit ratings of BBB- , with a negative outlook .What this means is our long-term local currency debt, which forms 88.2% of our R2.2 trillion net debt, retains its investment-grade rating from Standard &amp; Poor s. However, despite this Standard &amp; Poor s raised serious concerns about political infighting undermining economic growth and fiscal consolidation, which is reflected in their negative outlook for South Africa.What Standard &amp; Poor s ratings action confirms is that the civil war within the governing party is killing the economy, and that is why a staggering 9.3 million people do not have jobs, or have given up looking for jobs, in South Africa.
