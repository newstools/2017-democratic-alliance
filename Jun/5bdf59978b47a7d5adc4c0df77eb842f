The Democratic Alliance is deeply saddened and shocked by the fatal shooting of Xolile Gwanxu, a councillor in the greater Philippi area, who was ambushed by unknown assailants last night.Councillor Gwanxu, a long-standing DA member, was a well-known and respected leader in the area he served, and he did so with honourable commitment and determination.Mr Gwangxu was shot dead after he facilitated a meeting which was held at his office in the local community hall last night.His killer or killers are alleged to have shot him as he was busy locking up the venue following the meeting.The DA welcomes the police&#8217;s investigation into the matter and we hope the perpetrator or perpetrators will soon be apprehended.Our thoughts are with his family during this sad time.
