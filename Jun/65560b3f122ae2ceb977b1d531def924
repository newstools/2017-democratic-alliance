The Democratic Alliance notes the fact that Judge Vally has granted the President leave to appeal against his order that the President has to provide the record of decision and reasons for this decision to drop Pravin Gordhan from the Cabinet.We are encouraged by Judge Vally s statement that: I have come to the conclusion that there is no reasonable prospect that another court would come to a different conclusion. However, he found that there were compelling reasons, mainly relating to the public interest in the case, that justified granting leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal.Judge Vally noted that both the President and the DA agreed that the matter is urgent and, as he put it, The door remains open to the President and the DA to approach that Court (the SCA) for an expedited hearing. The DA intends to pursue this appeal with urgency and we will be addressing a letter in this regard to the President of the SCA on Monday morning.
