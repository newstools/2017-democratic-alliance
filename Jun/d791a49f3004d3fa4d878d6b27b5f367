Note to Editors: Copies of the correspondence between David Maynier MP, DA Shadow Minister of Finance, and the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, can be found [here].We should be debating the fact that we are in deep economic trouble in South Africa.However, the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, has refused my request for a debate on an urgent matter of national public importance, in terms of National Assembly Rule 130, to debate measures to deal with the economic crisis in South Africa.The reason my request for a snap debate on measures to deal with the economic crisis was refused is absurd. The Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, believes the matter can be considered by some other means in the near future . However, she must know:The Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, knows there is absolutely no prospect of this matter being dealt with by other means in the near future and is simply protecting President Jacob Zuma and Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba, from a tough debate on measures to deal with the economic crisis in South Africa.We are not going to take this lying down and will continue to fight to schedule a national debate on the economic crisis in South Africa.
