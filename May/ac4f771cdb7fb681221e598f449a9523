At today s Portfolio Committee meeting for the Department of Trade and Industry, the ANC decided to bulldoze through the reappointment of controversial National Lotteries Commission Chairperson, Professor Alfred Nevhutanda, despite his chequered and controversial past.The DA has therefore submitted parliamentary questions to Minister Rob Davies requesting his record of decision to recommend Professor Nevhutanda to the short list considered by the Portfolio Committee.Professor Nevhutanda has a well-documented, scandal-ridden history, including:While Chairperson of the Board:It is quite clear that Professor Nevuthanda is not a suitable candidate for this important position, conflicted by political ideology.The actions of the ANC today, despite the DA s objections, clearly proves that this matter was decided by Luthuli House, long before the interview process even began and then rubber-stamped by the portfolio committee.The DA will continue to hold Professor Nevhutanda accountable for his management of the National Lotteries Commission and ensure that no funding is made available to politically aligned organisations as we have seen under his current chairpersonship.
