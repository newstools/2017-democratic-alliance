There is now support across party lines for a full-scale Parliamentary Inquiry into the multiple scandals, governance failures and the Molefe fiasco at Eskom.I have written to Acting Chairperson of the Committee, Zukiswa Rantho, urging her to commence a full-scale investigation into Eskom without any delay, as support for such an inquiry is now broad and bi-partisan.Late yesterday the ANC issued a statement calling for Parliamentary action to be taken after Eskom s appearance before the committee yesterday. On the basis of this statement from the ANC, I fully expect ANC members in the committee to support the call I have made for a full-scale inquiry to commence.I also challenge Minister Brown to submit herself to this inquiry and to cooperate fully.This inquiry must probe the damning scandals that have engulfed Eskom recently, including:While Minister Brown yesterday alluded to an investigation which she wants to launch into Eskom s procurement only, this will only scratch the surface of the deep-seated rot at Eskom, and a far more broad probe is needed into the capture, looting and all out governance collapse at Eskom.Only Parliament can get to the bottom of this.I expect that Acting Chairperson Rantho will announce this full-scale Parliamentary Inquiry without delay.
