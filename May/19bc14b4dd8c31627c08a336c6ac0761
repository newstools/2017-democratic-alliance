The DA has triumphed in yesterday s by-election in Beaufort West s Ward 7, retaining the ward and ensuring DA-led governance continues in the municipality.Voters in the Ward 7 by-election came out in their numbers to endorse the DA, growing our support from 46,8% in 2016 to 56,9% in the ward yesterday.This is an endorsement of the DA s brand of good governance, where voters recognise that only the DA continues to deliver better services, cuts corruption and creates jobs.In absolute vote terms, over 660 more voters chose to vote DA in this ward yesterday, over our tally in 2016. This surge in support for the DA is very encouraging.By-election after by-election voters continue to shift toward the DA, and this bodes very well for the run up to Election 2019.The DA thanks every voter in Ward 7 who came out to support us for the trust that they have placed in the DA. Our every effort will continue to go into making progress in Beaufort West and turning around the municipality, together with our coalition partner, the KDF.I would also like to thank every DA activist, public representative and staff member who worked tirelessly toward this victory together.
