The following speech was delivered in Parliament today by DA Shadow Minister of Defence, Kobus Marais MP, during the Budget Vote on Defence.Chairperson,Our Constitution confirms in Article 200 (2) that the primary object of the defence force is to defend and protect the Republic, its territorial integrity and its people in accordance with the Constitution and the principles of international law regulating the use of force .In the light of the continuous budget decrease, especially in defence real terms (12%), it is becoming ever more difficult to simply maintain the defence force we have, let alone to support the defence force envisaged in the 2015 Defence Review.Similar to last year, we will still not be able to fund Milestone 1 &#8211; arrest the decline .In order to maintain a reasonable defence force, a year-on-year budget of at least 2% of GDP must be maintained.This has not happened and is not foreseen over the Medium Term Framework, although it did not deter the Minister, Cabinet and the Department of Defence (DoD) from retaining their unrealistic ideological objectives, operational plans, and international commitments.Our GDP, currently below 1%, and the national priorities of government do not provide for an ideal defence force.There is a disjunction between the defence force government wants on paper &#8211; either from an ideological or an egotistical point of view &#8211; what we can afford, and what we actually need to comply with our Constitutional obligations.Keep in mind we have no conventional warfare threat at our borders.The DoD has confirmed we have a window period of only 3 to 5 years to address the decline in the South African National Defence Force&#8217;s (SANDF) capacities before its capabilities will be totally depleted.Some of the current shocking national deployable capacity statistics are:National Treasury has indicated the funds requested by the DoD and the Minister will not be approved and that the DoD must &#8220;cut their cloth to size and operate within the means of our economy.Indeed, Treasury has not made it a secret that it appears the DoD do not intend to comply with their recommended austerity measures. Most notable was the directive that the HR spending of the DoD must be reduced from 57% to 40% of their budget.The current funding requirements are unaffordable. The budget allocation of R48 billion will only fund the first two of the five phases to complete milestone 1, for which the DoD requires a further R55.7 billion for 2017/18 alone. We know the economy cannot afford this.Let s be honest, Minister, we must reprioritise and restructure the SANDF to balance what we can afford with what we need. Both you, Cabinet and the DoD must realise that your signed-off and idealistic plans are unaffordable, unrealistic and unachievable. Non-essential costs and commitments must be eliminated.One example of avoidable expenses is the constant leasing of private aircraft, both for the President s comfort and to transport our troops and equipment to the DRC. How many flying hours and funds are wasted for this?Another example dealing with an unnecessary requirement is our favourite aircraft Inkwazi.Contrary to the arguments, this luxury jet has been fully operational, while neither the President, nor the Deputy President, nor you have used Inkwazi since at least the end of June 2016.Yet, at least 50 flights were undertaken to Langebaan, East London, Overberg, Bloemfontein, Hoedspruit, Durban, etc. Who is using it?The argument that this is for pilot training cannot be justified.If there is no use for this aircraft, why train pilots to fly it?An unused, fully operational Presidential Jet is a showpiece, and only an attempt keep up with the Jones . We cannot afford that, Minister.At the same time, you have indicated the appetite for yet another new regional VVIP Jet.Why not rather sell Inkwazi or utilise it for the regional flight requirements? We cannot afford both as it will equate to reckless trading.Minister, when the DA takes over the Union Buildings in 2019, will develop a sustainable and well-funded defence force, by:We will also improve our cyber warfare capabilities, specifically the use of drones for land border patrol and protection.Voorts sal ons die kundigheid van Krygkor beter benut om ons verdediginsgbedryf te laat groei en ontwikkel sodat die 9miljoen werkloses volhoubare werk kan geniet.Although this department requires a budget closer to 2% of GDP, we have to apply our current budget optimally and in the best interest of our citizens.Op n positiewe noot. Almal moet nog net vir twee jaar vasbyt. Daarna sal n DA-geleide regering vinnig die Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Weermag op n positiewe trajek plaas in die beste belang van die weermag en al ons inwoners.
