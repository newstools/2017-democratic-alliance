705 overjoyed Tshwane residents received title deeds to their state-subsidised houses this weekend.Solly Msimanga&#8217;s administration is speeding up the delivery of title deeds to state-subsidised houses so that recipients have legal ownership of the property where they reside or operate businesses from, giving homeowners an important economic asset to leverage. You are now the sole and legal owner of the house being allocated and registered in your name. Home ownership is an exciting experience, as it restores pride, dignity and respect.&#8221;&#8211; MMC for Housing and Human Settlements, Cllr Mandla NkomoThe title deeds were handed over to beneficiaries who have been allocated low cost houses or serviced stands in Hammanskraal West Extensions 1 and 2 in Ward 49.
