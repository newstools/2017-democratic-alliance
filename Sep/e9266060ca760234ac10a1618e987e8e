Students of the Lovedale TVET College have elected the Democratic Alliance Student Organisation (DASO) candidate, Zikona Mbewu, as the SRC President of the college. Yesterday, DASO also assumed control of the Alice Campus SRC with an overwhelming majority of 5 out of 7 seats.DASO in the Eastern Cape welcomes these results with great excitement. More and more South African students trust the DA and DASO to represent them. Our share of the votes grew from 15% to 46% in the last election.It reflects the growing support and trust that the DA has amongst young South Africans from poor and vulnerable backgrounds who are desperate for an alternative that can give them the opportunities to break out of the shackles of poverty, illiteracy and unemployment.Lovedale College Alice Campus students have exercised their right to vote for a well-run SRC that will ensure a safe, caring, inclusive and forward-thinking campus with opportunities for all students.We would like to thank all these students for their support in this election and all our activists who have worked tirelessly throughout the campaign to ensure that we secure a victory for students. When DASO wins, all students win.This win will allow us to attempt to put an end to the years of corruption and mismanagement by both the SASCO-led SRCs and alleged ANC-aligned management at the campus. We are confident that the best days are ahead of us and soon Lovedale College students will finally see an SRC that works selflessly and advocates for their needs and welfare.&nbsp;
