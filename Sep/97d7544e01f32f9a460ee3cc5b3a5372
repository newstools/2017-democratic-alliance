The Democratic Alliance Students Organisations (DASO) in Mpumalanga wishes to congratulate our student at the eMalahleni TUT campus, Mr Marcus Mdau, for being elected Deputy President of the 2017/2018 Student Representative Council.After a hotly contested SRC election which resulted in the DASO structure receiving one seat, a decision was made by all student political groups that the DASO student be placed as Deputy to the helm.It is the first time DASO has ever contested on this campus and true to our form, we have hit the ground running. It seems students from the campus agreed with Marcus&#8217; presentation of our manifesto, as DASO is associated to decisive decision making, addressing issues on campus and forming part of DASO Mpumalanga quest in trying to address the ever tedious and ever volatile NSFAS funding woes.
