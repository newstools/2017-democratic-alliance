Please find the attached soundbites in IsiZulu and English. It is clear that Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba, only removed Dudu Myeni from the SAA Board because he was forced to do so by the people who have lent SAA money. Lenders to the airline would not extend their loans to SAA. The airline is bankrupt and needs R10 billion in order to continue trading until the end of the current financial year. Gigaba is not a knight in shining armour. The restructuring of the Board will not save SAA. The airline simply cannot be saved.
