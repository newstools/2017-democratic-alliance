Attached please find sound bites in IsiZulu and English. We can all agree that the murder rate in South Africa has reached levels never before experienced and every person in our country knows the feeling of fearing for their life and the lives of their loved ones. We know that in the last year three specific groups have been particularly affected: • Every day, seven women and children are murdered;
• Every day, in the Western Cape alone, almost two people are killed in gang-related violence; and
• In the last year, at least 74 people in rural communities have been brutally murdered. The Rural Safety crisis affects all who live in rural areas, both farmers, farmworkers, their families, and other residents. Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula, is solely responsible for the safety of all South Africans, a task at which he is clearly failing. It is high time that Minister Mbalula urgently reinstate the specialised units that succeeded in targeting specific issues such as rural safety, drug and gang-related crime but were shut down with no effective alternative to replace them. Every life lost in these tragic crimes is one life too many. Enough is enough.
