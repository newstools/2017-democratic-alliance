The ANC in Tshwane resorted to the lowest form of racism during a sitting of the Tshwane Council this afternoon by hurling racist insults at learners from a local school who were attending the sitting. The Grade 10 learners, who the ANC labelled “Voortrekkers” once introduced, were in the Chamber in order to get a deeper understanding of the City’s administration and politics but instead receiving end of the ANC’s vitriol. It is clear that the ANC does not have the interests of South Africa and the youth in mind and will stoop to racism to advance their argument. The ANC will be punished at the polls in 2019, when the people of South Africa reject their lies and looting, and vote for a new beginning under a DA-led coalition government.
