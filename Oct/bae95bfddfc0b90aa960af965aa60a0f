The DA calls on President Jacob Zuma to suspend Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane from her position as Public Protector pending Parliament’s inquiry into her fitness to hold office. President Zuma is empowered to suspend Adv. Mkhwebane now that the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has agreed to our request to initiate proceedings to remove her, as per Section 2(1)(c) of the Public Protector Act (No. 23 of 1994). According to Section 194(3)(a) of the Constitution: (3) The President— (a) may suspend a person from office at any time after the start of the proceedings of a committee of the                       National Assembly for the removal of that person; Adv.  Mkhwebane has demonstrated numerous times that she is not fit to hold the office of the Public Protector and the DA has opposed her appointment from the start. The most glaring examples of her alleged misconduct include: The fractures in the ANC Caucus has once again come to the fore with their Members serving on the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services voting in favour of an inquiry into Adv. Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office only for a subsequent press release to slam it. Once again the work of Parliament is undermined by ANC infighting. The Office of the Public Protector is a crucial institution in the fight against injustice and the rot of State Capture, and Adv. Mkhwebane is not the person to lead it.
