We welcome the fact that the Chief Executive Officer of the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA), Bernard Agulhas, has decided to “fast track” the investigation into KPMG South Africa. However, the fact that KPMG South Africa has reportedly failed to fully cooperate with the investigation, as they promised to do in their mea culpa on or about 15 September 2017, is a major concern. We also welcome the fact that it has been determined that the forensic audit into the so-called SARS “Rogue Unit”, conducted by KPMG South Africa, and was finalised on 04 December 2015, was in fact signed off by a registered auditor, and is therefore a matter that falls within the mandate of IRBA. I have, therefore, written to the Chief Executive Officer of IRBA, Bernard Agulhas, formally requesting him to extend the scope of the investigation to include the conduct of the auditor responsible for forensic audit into the so-called SARS “Rogue Unit”.
