The DA is in possession of a letter from a Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA) employee in which he outlines the daily “wrath of victimisation and unfair treatment” which staff at the entity is subjected to. The letter outlines the employee’s “disappointment on how the Ministry [of Communications] has ignored issues raised by the staff when they wrote and signed a petition [and that] [i]t gives me an impression that the Ministry is not protecting us as underdogs against the mighty and powerful”. What makes matters worse, is that after various allegations of intimidation by senior officials at the MDDA came to light, the Minister of Communications, Ayanda Dlodlo, conducted an oversight visit to the entity a week ago where she proceeded to intimidate the employees. The Minister allegedly told MDDA employees that they were not allowed to speak out about the victimisation or intimidation that they are subjected to. The DA will now proceed to report Minister Dlodlo to the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interest for her inappropriate conduct. Instead of addressing these concerns, the Minister is now contributing to the toxic atmosphere at the entity. It now seems like Faith Muthambi’s replacement is following in her footsteps. The DA will simply not allow this intimidation and victimisation to happen at another Communications entity.
