The DA will report former Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula to the Public Protector following reports that sporting goods supplier, Sedgars Sports, allegedly paid for at least half of his R680 000 family trip to Dubai from 28 December 2016 until 3 January 2017. Sedgars Sports is contracted to supply clothing for the South African Sports Confederation and Olympics Committee (SASCOC) and their business ties date as far back as 2005. Since SASCOC was under Mbalula’s purview as Sports Minister, there was a clear conflict of interest and Mbalula breached the Executive Members Ethics Code, which states that: 2.3 Members of the Executive may not (f) expose themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and their private interests Section 4.1 of the Code also states that a member may not solicit or accept a gift or benefit which; (c) constitutes an attempt to influence the member in the performance of the member’s duties. Mbalula’s relationship with Sedgars Sports was improper and he compromised his integrity and impartiality by allegedly allowing the company to pay for the trip. He must, therefore, account for his failure to abide by the rules set out for all public representatives. Executive Members are required to uphold the integrity of the positions they hold and ensure that their ability to exercise impartiality is not in any way undermined. The DA will not hesitate to hold those who fail to do so accountable.
