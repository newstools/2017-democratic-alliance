The DA welcomes the reported removal of Dudu Myeni from the South African Airways (SAA) board. She has done untold damage to SAA and should not have been reappointed to the board, and certainly not as board chair, in September 2016. The question remains as to where Malusi Gigaba is going to find the R 10 billion that is required to meet the R 5,2 billion already paid to SAA for loans and working capital as well as the R 4,8 billion required as working capital to keep the airline trading until the end of the 2017/18 financial year. The crisis at SAA has now got so bad that the Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba, was apparently finally forced to take action in an effort to stop the mismanagement at SAA. The reported restructuring of the SAA board apparently includes an experienced aviation expert, after a year a calling for this since the current board was appointed on the 1st of September 2016. Make no mistake, this reported restructuring of the SAA board and the removal of Myeni is far too little, too late to save the airline. There is no saving SAA.
