The DA fully supports the right of SABC staff to engage in legal strike action. Many of the demands contained in today’s final letter of demand sent to SABC management by the Broadcasting, Electronic Media and Allied Workers Union (BEMAWU) and the Communications Workers Union (CWU) are reasonable, particularly: The brilliant work initiated by the interim board to steer the SABC to calm waters has been stalled, and the public broadcaster has begun sliding backwards. The SABC has many talented, qualified staff who care deeply about ensuring that the public broadcaster delivers on its mandate to South Africa. They are therefore well within their rights to take action to prevent the SABC sliding backwards and once again becoming a cesspool of corruption, mismanagement and poor programming. We will request that the meeting agreed upon by Parliament’s Communications Committee this week to allow for the SABC 8 and BEMAWU to appear in order to tell their side of the story be scheduled within the week. We are also currently exploring what steps we can take to force President Zuma to appoint the permanent SABC board. Many of the concerns raised by the SABC staff could have been prevented did the SABC have a board in place. The DA looks forward to engaging with the SABC’s staff, the individuals who work tirelessly, and often thanklessly to keep the SABC on air.
