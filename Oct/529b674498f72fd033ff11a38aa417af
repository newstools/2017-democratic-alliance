The DA would like to take this opportunity to wish all Hindu South Africans a happy Diwali today and tomorrow. The festival of lights provides us with the opportunity to reflect on the importance of family and friendship. May the values of tolerance and freedom continue to be the guiding light in our country as we look forward to creating a prosperous future for fellow South Africans. May this time also remind us of the bonds we share and our collective responsibility to strive for peace and prosperity for all. Â
