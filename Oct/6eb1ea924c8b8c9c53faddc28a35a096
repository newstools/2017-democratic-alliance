The DA welcomes the decision by the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services to hold an inquiry into the Public Protector’s fitness to hold office. Removal proceedings against Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane were initiated by ourselves on 20 September 2017. We now call on the committee to proceed with the inquiry with the urgency and seriousness it demands. Today’s decision by the committee adds credence to the DA’s contention that Adv. Mkhwebane is not fit to occupy the position of Public Protector. In less than a year since her appointment, Adv. Mkhwebane has demonstrated what the DA knew already: that she is unsuitable for the position of Public Protector and only undermines the important work done by the Office. The work of her predecessor, Adv. Thuli Madonsela, greatly strengthened our democracy and provided a bulwark against state corruption. However, the inept and discredited work done by Adv. Mkhwebane threatens to undermine public confidence in the Public Protector’s Office, precisely at a time when South Africa needs it most. The DA opposed Mkhwebane’s appointment as Public Protector. Yet South Africa does not need to tolerate a compromised figure seeking to undermine the Public Protector’s Office. Adv. Mkhwebane can and will be removed, in terms of Section 194 of the Constitution, and we look forward to making our case for her removal in committee.
