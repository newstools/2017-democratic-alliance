The acting Chief Procurement Officer, Willie Mathebula, crashed-and-burned during today’s finance committee hearing at Parliament. He was poorly prepared, produced a pathetic presentation, and was incapable of properly responding to questions, including questions that were furnished to him before the hearing. The questions focused inter alia on the restructuring of the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, reviews of state contracts exceeding R10 million, and the Nuclear Build Programme. The fear that the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, which is one of the most important institutions in the fight against state capture, has been “defanged”, seems to have been confirmed.
