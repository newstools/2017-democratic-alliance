Today, the DA received a flippant response from President Jacob Zuma rejecting my call to him to declare 16 August a commemorative day in honour of the 34 mineworkers who were tragically gunned down by the police in Marikana in 2012. This tragedy remains a national disaster which the ANC government refuses to account for. Our call is made on behalf of those who died during this week as well as their families and loved ones. Â We acknowledged that there have been events that have taken place on this day, but this is not enough. This rejection means the ANC government has turned a blind eye on the wounds that still exists. The call for a commemorative day on 16 August, is about justice and remembrance of those who lost their lives. Five years after the horrific massacre, life in Marikana still paints a grim picture of hopelessness and despair. The family members of the deceased mineworkers continue to suffer as they have been forgotten. Many of the mothers and wives lost their sole breadwinners. The tragic events of Marikana will remain embedded in our collective memory, forever. We simply cannot forget that fateful day. It is now clear that the ANC government has washed their hand off the slain Marikana victims.
