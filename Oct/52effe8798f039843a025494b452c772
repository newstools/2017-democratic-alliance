Please find attached soundbites in English, Sesotho and isiXhosa by the DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Basic Education, Nomsa Marchesi MP. The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has failed, yet again, to meet its own school infrastructure targets under the Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (ASIDI) leaving children to learn without access to water, electricity or proper sanitation. Specifically, the DBE has: The DA will submit questions to Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, on why this gross mismanagement of the ASIDI programme has been allowed to go on for so long. The Minister must answer fully for why she allows children to continue to be subjected to shocking learning conditions. The DA has been and will continue to visit schools across the country exposing the collapsing infrastructure and the Financial and Fiscal Commission has shown the Basic Education Portfolio Committee just how terrible the situation is. Our children cannot be expected to excel and build bright futures when they have been deprived of their right to a safe and conducive learning environment.
