The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Adv Shaun Abrahams, has today confirmed to me in writing that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has commenced its preparation towards the 783 counts of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges against Jacob Zuma and that the evidence is available and ready, and the witness list set to be finalised by 30 November 2017. The DA looks forward to a trial date being set shortly after the witness list is finalised, and we will now begin preparing for trial. Adv Abrahams was responding to a letter I wrote to him last week, following the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) decision which found that the decision to drop 783 charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering against Jacob Zuma was irrational, and set aside. Today, Abrahams confirmed the following: While we welcome this action, we are of the belief that Jacob Zuma is being afford special treatment by the NPA.Â Any other person would be hauled before a court and charged. Yet, this is not the case with Jacob Zuma. He should be notified of his Court date immediately, like any other accused and the court process should commence. President Zuma himself has stated on numerous occasions that he wants his day in court, and after an 8 and a half year legal fight, we are the cusp of such a reality. Jacob Zuma must realise that no one, including himself, is above the law.
