The #Change19 tour moved to Morokweng, in the North West where DA Leader Mmusi Maimane continued to engage with community members during his door-to-door visits and public meetings. I wa s left saddened and angry at the conditions that many people here have to live in. &#8211; Mmusi Maimane We can&#39;t accept that a whole generation will have nothing to look forward to but unemployment, crime, drugs and teenage pregnancy. #Change19 pic.twitter.com/39tIajzxZs&mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) August 1, 2017Our government only cares about the wealth of Zuma &amp; the Guptas instead of the welfare of ordinary men, women &amp; children like you. #Change19 pic.twitter.com/hksk7s7uFe&mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) August 1, 2017In the 2019 election, you will have the opportunity to use the power of your vote and save our country. &#8211; @MmusiMaimane #Change19 pic.twitter.com/VcwoKNGfgh&mdash; Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) August 1, 2017The leader went on to remind the people of Morokweng how the ANC government has proven, over and over again, that it does not have the will to kick a corrupt president and his corrupt cronies out, and that their only hope lies in a fresh start under a new government.Until we rid our government of the parasites that suck our country dry, communities like Morokweng will always suffer because it&#8217;s impossible to serve both the Guptas greed and the people s needs.-Mmusi MaimaneHe also assured the community that should they lend us their votes in 2019, we will make their needs our priority and we will not forget them like the ANC government has done.
