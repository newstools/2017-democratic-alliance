However, this has failed and rightly so.The DA have long been of the view that Dlamini manufactured the crisis, possibly for financial gain.This is a welcome a step towards ensuring that Dlamini is held accountable and will shed light on the real reasons as to why SASSA was not able to institutionalise the grants payment system.The DA looks forward to a date for the Inquiry being set and to ensuring that the Minister is made to face up to playing games.
