It&#8217;s with disappointment to have recently learnt that our newly elected DASO chairperson Xolani Nyalunga was yesterday attacked and physically assaulted by CN Mahlangu Campus SRC chairperson Given Sibanyoni and his friends. Given is a member of the EFFSC and it is clear that he and his cronies feel intimidated by DASO.Recently, a DASO branch was successfully launched in this campus and now he is clearly scared that DASO will win the SRC elections in October which is why Given and his dangerous cronies decided to attack Xolani; beat him, kick him and even stole his cellphone.This act of thuggery is uncalled for and intolerant.It must be made very clear that there is no space for violence, intimidation, bigotry and intolerance in our spaces. This is not an act of politics but a barbarian tendency which shows political immaturity and lack of emotional intelligence.Student activism spaces are to contest ideas and ways to improve student lives not to test out testosterone levels and that is essentially why DASO is needed in that campus; to ensure that there is a safe campus and there is no student left behind.We are not going to allow such people to exist in spaces of learning that are supposed to be incubators of ideas. As such, a police case will be opened at the Siyabuswa Police Station.Furthermore, I will be writing to the president of the EFFSC to allay my concerns and give him the opportunity to take a responsible corrective action from his side.We condemn this kind of irresponsible behaviour and we call for serious action to be taken to discipline all those involved including this person who is supposed to be a leader in the Institution.
