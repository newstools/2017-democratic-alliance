The Msimanga administration will pay for the funerals of the 5 children who were tragically killed by a streetlight in Soshanguve. It is suspected that the defective streetlight was as a result of the vandalism that is inflicted on the City’s infrastructure. The DA-led multi-party administration has also committed to doing all that it can to get to the bottom of what occasioned these deaths and provide details of what happened and how the administration will endeavour to prevent it from happening in future as part of the Msimanga administration’s commitment to creating an inclusive Tshwane where children can live and play freely in their communities.
