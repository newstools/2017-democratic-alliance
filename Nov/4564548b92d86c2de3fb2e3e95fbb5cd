DA-led Johannesburg Mayor, Cllr Herman Mashaba forfeited his international travel budget in order to fund the extension of service hours at Princess Clinic in Roodeport, following a cry for help from a mother of a sick daughter who resides in  Princess Park Informal Settlement. The Princess Clinic project, which was adopted on the 1st of November last year entailed extending service hours from the normal eight hours to 15 hours, Monday to Friday and from 07:00 to 13:00 on Saturdays, which added a further six hours. Since the beginning of the extended hours at the clinic, 7000 patients have been helped.  Due to the success of the pilot project at Princess Clinic, the extended hours were rolled out to five other clinics in the City, namely: o   Freedom Park Clinic; o   Hikensile Clinic; o   Randburg Clinic; o   Zandspruit Clinic; and o   Albert Street Clinic. In just 12 months since the Mayor launched extended hours, there has been an increase of those who access the City’s health institutions after hours, especially working mothers.
 The Mayor promised the residents of Princess Park Informal Settlement that he will continue to serve them with dedication by improving service delivery across the city. Read the full article here.
