On Tuesday, the City of Cape Town officially launched the MyCiti bus rides for unemployed residents, in order to support them in their efforts to find employment. This is another initiative aimed at providing opportunities to the residents most in need. Only unemployed residents who are registered on the City’s Expanded Public Works Programme job seekers’ database qualify for this opportunity. The concession applies to those job seekers who are registered at Subcouncils 1, 3, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 23 or 24. These subcouncils fall in the MyCiTi footprint and are served by MyCiTi routes. Job seekers who are registered on the city’s unemployment database will receive a free myconnect card, loaded with a special travel package. This will allow two free one-way journeys every week on any MyCiTi route. This includes changing from one bus or route to another to reach a destination. Travel can take place on any weekday starting between 09:00 and 10:00 or between 14:00 and 15:00. The journey can end outside of these times, but job seekers must ensure that they start their journey within these time periods. Applicants must apply at the subcouncil office where they are registered on the job seekers’ database by presenting their identity document and completing an application form.  Job seekers registered at the following subcouncils qualify for the free MyCiTi rides:   Job seekers needing more information or assistance can call the Transport Information Centre (TIC) on 0800 65 64 63. The TIC is available 24/7 and agents can assist callers in English, Afrikaans and isiXhosa. Other strategies being implemented to address unemployment in the City of Cape Town:
