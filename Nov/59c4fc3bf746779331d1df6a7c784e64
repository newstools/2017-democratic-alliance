Please find attached IsiZulu and English soundbites by the DA Shadow Minister of Social Development, Bridget Masango MP. Today, the Minister of Social Development, Bathabile Dlamini, will be answering questions in Parliament and she must brace herself for a grilling from the DA. The DA will not shy away from asking the Minister tough questions, as she has time and again proven that she simply does not care about the people of this country. The DA will ask the Minister about the full details of the offer SASSA made to the South African Post Office for paying out of social grants and whether the Department of Social Development (DSD) has a strategy in place to address the lack of infrastructure development for rural offices of the DSD and SASSA? The Minister has made a habit of playing the victim whenever she has to account to Parliament. She is not the victim here, the millions of South Africans she continues to fail are. Minister Dlamini is once again trying to put our people’s grants in danger, because as we believe, just so the dodgy CPS contract can continue to distribute grants, for Dlamini’s own gain. The DA will not stand for this and Dodging Dlamini must tell the nation why she is failing the people of our country.
