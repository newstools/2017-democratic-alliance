The DA has written to the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Thandi Modise, in terms of Section 139(1) (b) of the Constitution, regarding the irregular consideration of the amendment of the Report of the Select Committee of COGTA which deals with the Notice of Intervention in eMadlangeni Local Municipality.To date, the DA has not received any response from the Chairperson.KZN COGTA Spokesperson, Lennox Mabaso, seemingly misled the public when he said that the MEC had been invited to answer some questions to the Select Committee on the intervention. The meeting was only called urgently as a result of pressure by the MEC on the ANC.Mabaso further lied that the committee supported the intervention. In the urgent meeting, the SC decided to keep the report unchanged that the NCOP should disapprove the intervention. This was also evident when the Chairperson of the SC read the report out in the Council before the consideration thereof.He further misled the public by stating that the information submitted by the MEC changed the committee s decision. Mabaso lacks the competency to read and listen, as he is also captured.The MEC is using the NCOP to fight her political battles. The amendment of the report was irregular and subsequently invalid. There can be no administration intervention in the eMadlangeni Local Municipality, based on this irregularity.We urge Thandi Modise to respond as a matter of urgency, given the seriousness of the implications if the irregular consideration is condoned.We reiterate our call for the Premier to recall this errant, arrogant MEC with immediate effect.
