On the 23rd of August 2017, the City of Johannesburg will have its first tightly contested by-election since last year s local government elections.Ward 124 is now the new battleground in the City of Johannesburg.Since taking office, the DA-led coalition government has worked tirelessly to bring change to the city by delivering quality basic services, fighting corruption and creating an environment for growing job opportunities for all residents.However, the process of fully realising the change demanded by our city s residents will take time.It also means that every single seat in the City s Council must be used for the business of driving the delivery of quality services.That is why we must make use of every available opportunity to win over ANC seats in every by-election within the City.The previous ANC-led government s failure to prioritise the basics of service delivery can never be allowed to frustrate the residents of this city ever again.The residents of ward 124 will soon have to choose between strengthening the current DA-led coalition s drive to provide service delivery and clinging to the ineffectual ANC of the past.For ward 124, there can be no better councillor candidate than Mr Sizwe Silaze .Having lived in ward 124 for the past 18 years, Mr Silaze intimately understands the needs of this community.Mr Silaze currently serves as a PR Councillor within the City of Johannesburg and brings with him this expertise and an unwavering commitment to protecting the wellbeing of our residents.He is best known in ward 124 for his efforts in the fight to stop illegal evictions and his work to end the indignity suffered by those forced to live in hijacked buildings.The outcome of this by-election is not just about winning ward 124 but is about strengthening the DA-led coalition s continued efforts to building a better Johannesburg for all our residents.I urge all the residents of Ward 124 come out in their numbers for the upcoming by-election and help continue bringing change to our City.
