The sudden resignation of SASSA CEO, Thokozani Magwaza, is yet another damning indication of the toxic influence that Minister Bathabile Dlamini has on SASSA and the Department of Social Development (DSD).Magwaza is now the second senior official, after former DSD DG, Zane Dangor, who was coerced into resigning after his family s safety was threatened.The DA is gravely concerned about Magwaza s departure as he has played an important role in finding an alternative service provider in line with the Constitutional Court deadline of 31 March 2018.The relationship between Dlamini and Magwaza was severely strained by Dlamini s insistence to establishing the irregular workstreams and ensuring the continuation of the lucrative CPS contract.The DA will now write to the Minister to demand that she provides the reasons as to why Magwaza resigned.This entire debacle has been constructed by Dlamimi and is yet another example of the Minister s dodgy way of running the Department to the detriment of millions of South Africans.
