A reply to a DA parliamentary question details how the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Michael Masutha, considers convicted fraudster, Mr Shabir Shaik, to still be terminally ill, a full eight years after he was first unlawfully released on parole for health reasons.Despite being terminally ill, Mr Shaik s house arrest conditions have been relaxed to accommodate his needs. These include:It is quite astounding that a terminally ill man is able to work and attend sports, should he wish.It is also shocking that the last time his parole was assessed was two years ago.The reason for Mr Shaik s release on parole 8 years ago was clearly a farce he appears no closer to death today than he did at the time.Those responsible for this abuse and mockery of the parole system must be tracked down and held to account.
