The DA-led City of Johannesburg, on Friday night conducted a crime prevention operation in two well-known hijacked buildings in the inner city, Vannin Court and Florence House.The operation was led by the City s Group Forensic and Investigation Service Unit in conjunction with the South African Police Service (SAPS), Department of Home Affairs, Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), Emergency Management Services (EMS) and the City s Health and Social Development Departments.Hijacked buildings are a major problem in the inner city, with people living in deplorable conditions and being abused by slumlords who extort money from them. At Vannin Court, a City of Joburg owned building, it was found that the occupiers were renting beds in the units from owners for amounts ranging from R250 to R1200 per person.The city will now find alternative accommodation for the occupants, and will then be able to close off the buildings and ensure that they are redeveloped into low cost affordable housing for Johannesburg residents.&#8220;If we are going to turn around the decay of our inner city, it is vital that the rule of law is respected. I see the revitalisation of the inner city as key to ensuring economic growth and job creation in Joburg.I want to see rundown buildings turned into quality low cost housing for our residents and affordable rental spaces for small businesses. &#8221;&#8211; Executive Mayor, Herman Mashaba&nbsp;
