The City of Johannesburg is turning the tide on corruption. This time inside City Power, where the Managing Director, Sicelo Xulu has been immediately released from his contractual responsibilities.This comes after the contents of a damning forensic report, detailing serious misconduct on the part of the MD were revealed. The Board would ordinarily institute a disciplinary hearing, however the MD s contract is set to expire at the end of August and the City would not be able to complete the disciplinary process in time. It is for this reason that the Board has taken a decision to immediately release the MD from his contractual responsibilities.This decision which I fully support will begin the process of restoring good governance and ending corruption at the power utility. Weak corporate governance and corruption at City Power have for too long been allowed to rob our residents of much needed service delivery.&#8211; Executive Mayor, Herman MashabaThe Mayor has also instructed the City s Group Forensic and Investigation Service Unit to extract relevant information from the final report for the possible institution of criminal charges against numerous officials implicated; the full contents of the forensic report can thus not be revealed at this stage.Going forward, our priority will be to bring stability to City Power as we finalise the appointment of a new MD.&#8211; Executive Mayor, Herman Mashaba
