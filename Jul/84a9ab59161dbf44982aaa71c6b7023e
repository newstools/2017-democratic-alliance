A soundbite by the DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, Natasha Mazzone MP.Today the DA laid criminal charges against the suspended Eskom Chief Financial Officer, Anoj Singh.Following Singh s alleged role in a range of corruption scandals and dodgy deals at the power utility, the DA has reason to believe that he has possibly breached the Public Finance Management Act.The time has come for all of those who have seemingly contributed to the looting of our public funds, face the full might of the law.The recent suspension of Singh does not absolve him from appearing before Parliament s inquiry into the rot at Eskom.The DA trusts that the SAPS will ensure that this case is fully investigated to expose Singh s apparent role in the rot of corruption that has manifested at Eskom.
